Postmortem: The Great API Outage of 2024

Issue Summary:

Duration: 4 hours, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The API service took an extended coffee break, leaving 30% of users in the dark without their real-time data updates.
Root Cause:
A mischievous misconfiguration in the load balancer decided to play hide-and-seek with the API servers, resulting in a traffic routing disaster.

Timeline:

10:00 AM (UTC): Monitoring alerts went berserk, shouting about a spike in 5xx errors.
10:05 AM: Engineers sprang into action, suspecting the API servers were up to no good.
10:30 AM: Investigation revealed the load balancer's mischievous behavior.
11:00 AM: The infrastructure team was summoned to vanquish the misconfiguration monster.
12:00 PM: Load balancer configuration was fixed, but the API service was still snoozing.
1:00 PM: Discovered that the misconfiguration had thrown the caching layer out of sync.
2:00 PM: The caching layer was given a good flush, and the API service woke up from its nap.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The load balancer's prank caused traffic to bypass the API servers.
Resolution: Load balancer configuration was corrected, and the caching layer was purged, bringing the API service back online.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes: Implement stricter load balancer configuration checks to prevent future mischief.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Revise and update load balancer configuration guidelines.
Introduce automated tests for load balancer configuration changes.
Enhance monitoring to catch load balancer shenanigans early.
We hope this postmortem not only sheds light on the incident but also brings a smile to your face. Remember, even in the darkest of times, a little humor can go a long way!
